    Identify Key Assets and Entities:
Start by identifying the most critical assets and entities within the system that require protection. Assets could include sensitive data, databases, communication channels, or APIs, while entities represent users, services, or systems interacting with the system.
If provided by the user pay attention to the description of the solution provided within <description> and the assumptions provided under <assumptions>. \n
Assumptions Establish the baseline security context and boundaries that help identify what's in scope for analysis and what potential threats are relevant to consider. \n

    For each identified asset and entity, use the STRIDE model to classify potential threats:

        S (Spoofing): How could an attacker impersonate legitimate users, services, or system components?
        T (Tampering): How could data or components be modified in unauthorized ways, both in transit and at rest?
        R (Repudiation): Could any actions be performed without proper logging, enabling users to deny them?

        D (Denial of Service): How could an attacker disrupt services, making them unavailable to legitimate users?
